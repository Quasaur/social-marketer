Feedly - Driving Traffic

## Q

How do the most successful content creators drive traffic to their website using Feedly?!

## A

Successful content creators don't just "post and pray" on Feedly; they treat it as a critical piece of their distribution and intelligence engine. While Feedly is an RSS reader, the most successful creators use it to bypass social media algorithms and land directly in the "digital morning paper" of their most loyal fans.
Here is how top-tier creators drive traffic using the platform:

1. The "Partial Feed" Strategy (The Hook)
Instead of providing the full article in their RSS feed, successful creators often configure their sites to send only a summary or a "teaser" to Feedly.

* The Logic: If the user can read the entire post within Feedly, they have no reason to visit the actual website.
* The Result: Curious readers are forced to click the "Read More" button, which redirects them to the creator's site for the full experience (and ad impressions/conversions).

2. Optimizing for "Feedly Discover"
Feedly has an internal search engine and "Discover" page used by millions. High-traffic creators ensure they are discoverable by:

* Niche Tagging: Using specific metadata and tags on their website (like "Growth Hacking" or "SaaS Marketing") so Feedly's AI, Leo, categorizes them correctly.
* High-Quality Feature Images: Feedly’s card view relies heavily on the og:image tag. Creators use striking, high-contrast thumbnails to stand out in a crowded feed of headlines.

3. Leveraging "Public Boards" for Authority
Top creators often curate Public Boards. They save their own best content alongside industry news.

* The Strategy: By sharing a link to their "Ultimate Guide to [Topic]" board on social media, they drive users to a curated Feedly environment.
* The Benefit: It positions the creator as a thought leader who knows the whole industry, not just their own work, which builds long-term subscriber loyalty.

4. Integration with the "Curation Economy"
Many influencers use Feedly as a source to find content, which they then share via Buffer or Hootsuite (integrated directly into Feedly Pro).

* Reciprocity: Creators follow other big names in their space. When they share another creator's work, that creator is more likely to see and share their content in return, creating a cross-pollination of traffic.

5. Training the AI (Feedly Leo)
Modern creators "teach" Feedly's AI what is important. By encouraging their audience to "Priority Follow" them, they ensure their content bypasses the noise and appears at the top of their followers' feeds every morning.
Summary Checklist for Traffic
| Feature | Best Practice |
|---|---|
| RSS Output | Set to "Summary" or "Excerpt" to force clicks. |
| Images | Use high-res 1200x630px images for the feed preview. |
| Frequency | Post consistently; Feedly users love a predictable "daily" or "weekly" rhythm. |
| Keywords | Include industry-standard terms in the first 50 words for AI categorization. |

## Q

In my  case the content isn't blog posts, but compact texts and images containing proverbs, maxims, adages and quotes from my books.

## A

That changes the strategy significantly. Since your content is "snackable"—short, punchy, and visual—the goal isn't necessarily to hide the content to force a click, but to use Feedly as a brand-building gallery that leads to your books.
In your case, successful creators use Feedly as a "Daily Inspiration" channel. Here is how you can drive traffic to your books and website using short-form wisdom:

1. The "Watermarked Visual" Strategy
Since your adages and proverbs are likely shared as images or short text blocks, you shouldn't rely on "Read More" links alone.

* The Tactic: Embed your quotes into high-quality, stylized images (using tools like Canva or specialized design software).
* The Traffic Driver: Every image should have a subtle but clear URL watermark at the bottom (e.g., YourName.com/Books). When users save your images from Feedly to their own Pinterest boards or Evernote, your "buy link" stays attached to the art.

2. The "Contextual Anchor" Link
Feedly users appreciate brevity, but they also like depth. Below each maxim or proverb, include a consistent "Anchor" section in the text.

1. Curated "Themes" (The Feed Hierarchy)
Instead of one giant feed of random quotes, organize your website’s RSS feeds by topic. Successful creators often offer multiple RSS options:

* yoursite.com/proverbs/stoicism/feed
* yoursite.com/proverbs/leadership/feed
* The Benefit: This allows Feedly users to follow the specific "vibe" they want. When a user finds a niche feed they love, they are 10x more likely to click through to your "Books" page to see the full collection.

4. Use "Leo" to Target the Right Audience
Feedly’s AI, Leo, looks for "topics of interest." To ensure your quotes reach the right people:

* Keywords in Metadata: Even if the image is the main course, include 2–3 sentences of "Alt-Text" or a description below the quote using terms like Philosophy, Wisdom, Personal Growth, or Literary Quotes.
* The Result: When Feedly users follow a "Power Search" for "Daily Wisdom," your adages will appear in their stream.

5. The "Collection" Tease
Once a week, instead of a single proverb, post a "Weekly Digest" image—a collage of 5 quotes.

* The Hook: Provide the text for four of them, but make the fifth one a "Feedly Exclusive" or a "Sneak Peek" from your upcoming book that requires a click to your site to see the full design.
Suggested Feed Structure
| Element | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Header | The Proverb/Maxim in Bold or as an Image. |
| Body | A 1-sentence "Reflection" or the story behind the adage. |
| Footer | A permanent link: "Get the full collection in [Book Name]." |
